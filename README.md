# Base Dockerfiles for ComfyUI

This repo contains a collection of dockerfiles for running ComfyUI with a particular version and flavor of CUDA.

It is meant to be used alongside my [ComfyUI Environment Manager tool](https://github.com/akatz-ai/ComfyUI-Environment-Manager)

Docker images built and pushed to Dockerhub and can be [found here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/akatzai/comfyui-env/tags)

**Note:** I am not a security expert and am open to Issues and PRs that can help to harden the Images included in this repo.
